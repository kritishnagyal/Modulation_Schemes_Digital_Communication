# Modulation Schemes - Digital Communication Lab

This repository contains implementations and observations of key **digital modulation techniques** including **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**, **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)**, and **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)** as performed in the Digital Communication Laboratory.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement basic digital modulation schemes used in wireless and wired communication systems and to analyze their waveforms and characteristics.

## 🧪 Experiments Performed

### 1. 📡 Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

- **Principle:** In ASK, the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the binary input data.
- **Binary '1'** – Carrier signal is transmitted  
- **Binary '0'** – Carrier is turned off (or reduced)
- **Applications:** Low-bandwidth systems like RFID, early modems
- **Observation:** Output shows carrier wave for '1' and no carrier for '0'

### 2. 🔄 Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)

- **Principle:** The phase of the carrier signal is shifted by 180° based on the binary input.
- **Binary '1'** – Carrier with 0° phase  
- **Binary '0'** – Carrier with 180° phase shift
- **Applications:** Satellite and space communications due to noise resilience
- **Observation:** The phase of the carrier flips with each binary change

### 3. 🎶 Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

- **Principle:** The frequency of the carrier signal is changed based on the binary input.
- **Binary '1'** – High-frequency tone  
- **Binary '0'** – Low-frequency tone
- **Applications:** Telemetry, fax machines, caller ID systems
- **Observation:** Clear distinction in frequency levels for 0 and 1
